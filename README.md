The DriverPass project was focused on designing a system for a company called DriverPass, whose owner, Liam, wanted to improve how students prepare for their driving tests. The client needed a web-based system that would allow customers to take online classes and practice tests, schedule driving lessons, and manage their training progress. The system also needed to support multiple user roles, reservations, track activity, and integrate updates from the DMV to keep content current.
One thing I did particularly well was clearly organizing the system requirements and translating them into structured design components like use case diagrams, activity diagrams, and system features. I also did a good job identifying different user roles and making sure each one had the correct permissions and functionality, which is critical for a system with multiple types of users.
If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the user interface design portion. I would make it more detailed by including wireframes or mockups that better show how users interact with the system. This would make the design easier to understand and more aligned with the client’s expectations.
I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the interview transcript and identifying key requirements such as online scheduling, role-based access, progress tracking, and secure data handling. I then translated those needs into system features and diagrams. Considering user needs is extremely important because the system must be usable, efficient, and actually solve the client’s problem. Otherwise, even a technically sound system will fail.
When designing software, I take a structured approach that starts with gathering requirements, then modeling the system using diagrams, and finally refining the design based on feedback. It tends to be a lot of back in forth until a plan is set. In the future, I would continue using techniques like use case analysis, UML diagrams, prototyping, and iterative design. I would also focus more on user-centered design practices, such as gathering feedback early and often, to ensure the system truly meets user expectations.
